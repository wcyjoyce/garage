# Garage

This is a simple garage app that I created with React Router as part of [Le Wagon's](http://www.lewagon.com) React and Redux course. Supported by a [REST API](https://github.com/lewagon/garage-api#readme), users can add, delete and display a list of cars that enter their garage.

(I'm not a huge fan of the above reference layout so my app will look different, though the functions are more or less the same.)
